This folder contains the RL framework using PILCO and assuming an RWD dynamic model with rear wheel drive and no wheel slippage. It includes the loss, settings, ode dynamics, and learn file for PILCO.

To get STARTED: download PILCO via http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/pilco/, navigate to the scenarios folder in the download, and copy and past the entire RL_PILCO_RWD file into the scenarios folder. Open the pilcoRWD_learn.m file and run. 

If there are any issues, first check the pilcoRWD_settings.m file and make sure that you have modified your directory to access the VehicleDynamisModelRWD directory.
